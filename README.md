Hi Everyone, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Joseph Guzman,

I am currently working towards my PhD in Astrophysics from Florida State University.

My work is primarily involved in understanding which stars explode.

I often code in python and utilize bayesian inference techniques.

If you'd like to collaborate feel free to reach out!

My email is josephguzman1994@gmail.com
